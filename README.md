# Price-Prediction-for-Cars
This project involves different machine learning models for prediction.The aim of using different machine learning models is to come up with the best predicition for the price. The different ML models are : 
 Gradient Boost  regressor(XGBoost)
 Random Forest
 Logistic regression
 Support Vector machines 

## The following are the Overiew for the project
### Importing of libraries
Pandas and Numpy;for data loading and numerical analysis respectively.<br>
Data visualisation tools: Matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn.<br>
Checking for outliers in the data:Stats from Scipy.<br>
Handling warnings;Import warnings.<br>
